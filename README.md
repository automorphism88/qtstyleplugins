# qtstyleplugins

This is a mirror of https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtstyleplugins.git with tags
added to allow proper gentoo ebuild versioning in
https://github.com/automorphism88/gentoo-overlay - in other words, "releases"
are created based on upstream merge dates, since the last upstream release tag
is from January 2014, and no longer compiles with modern QT versions.
